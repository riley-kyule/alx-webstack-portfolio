nearley is a simple, fast and powerful parsing toolkit. It consists of:
1. [A powerful, modular DSL for describing
   languages](https://nearley.js.org/docs/grammar)
2. [An efficient, lightweight Earley
   parser](https://nearley.js.org/docs/parser)
3. [Loads of tools, editor plug-ins, and other
   goodies!](https://nearley.js.org/docs/tooling)

nearley is a **streaming** parser with support for catching **errors**
gracefully and providing _all_ parsings for **ambiguous** grammars. It is
compatible with a variety of **lexers** (we recommend
[moo](http://github.com/tjvr/moo)). It comes with tools for creating **tests**,
**railroad diagrams** and **fuzzers** from your grammars, and has support for a
variety of editors and platforms. It works in both node and the browser.

Unlike most other parser generators, nearley can handle *any* grammar you can
define in BNF (and more!). In particular, while most existing JS parsers such
as PEGjs and Jison choke on certain grammars (e.g. [left recursive
ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion)), nearley handles them
easily and efficiently by using the
