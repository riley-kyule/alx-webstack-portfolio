# node-url

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-url.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-url)

This module has utilities for URL resolution and parsing meant to have feature parity with node.js core [url](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html) module.

```js
var url = require('url');
```

## api

Parsed URL objects have some or all of the following fields, depending on
whether or not they exist in the URL string. Any parts that are not in the URL
string will not be in the parsed object. Examples are shown for the URL
