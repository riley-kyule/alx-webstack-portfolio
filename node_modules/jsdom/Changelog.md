## 11.6.2

* Fixed another regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where they would omit a series of parsing `"jsdomError"`s for any style sheet text containing spaces.
* Generally improved the spec-conformance of when `<style>` and `<script>` elements are evaluated; for example, `<script>` elements inserted by `innerHTML` are no longer evaluated.

## 11.6.1

* Fixed one regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where their `sheet` property would sometimes be `null` when it should not be.
* Fixed a case where a `<style>` element's `sheet` property would be left as a `CSSStyleSheet` despite it not being in the document.

Another regression remains where we are emitting spurious CSS-parsing `"jsdomError"` events; see [#2123](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2123). We also discovered a large amount of preexisting brokenness around `<style>`, `<link>`, and `@import`; see [#2124](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2124) for more details.

We'll try to fix these soon, especially the regression.

## 11.6.0

* Added a fully-functioning `WebSocket` implementation!
* Added a `window.performance` implementation, including the basics of the [High Resolution Time
