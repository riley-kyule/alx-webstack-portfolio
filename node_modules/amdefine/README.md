# amdefine

A module that can be used to implement AMD's define() in Node. This allows you
to code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without
requiring those other programs to use AMD.

## Usage

**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:

```javascript
    "dependencies": {
        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"
    }
```

Then run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.

**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:

```javascript
if (typeof define !== 'function') { var define = require('amdefine')(module) }
```

**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,
with the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).

You can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but
keep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior
