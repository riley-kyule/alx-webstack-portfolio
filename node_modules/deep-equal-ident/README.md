## Deep comparison with object identity checks  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fkling/deep-equal-ident.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fkling/deep-equal-ident)


This function performs a deep comparison between the two values `a` and `b`. It
has the same signature and functionality as [lodash's isEqual function](http://lodash.com/docs#isEqual),
with one difference: It also tracks the identity of nested objects.

This function is intended to be used for unit tests (see below how to use it
with chai.js).

### Installation

    npm install -S deep-equal-ident

and use it as

```javascript
var deepEqualIdent = require('deep-equal-ident');
// ...
if (deepEqualIdent(foo, bar)) {
 // deep equal
}
```

### Use with chai.js

This module provides integration with the [chai.js assertion framework](http://chaijs.com/)
(for Node.js at least).
Enable the extensions with

    chai.use(require('deep-equal-ident/chai'));

Then you can use either the `expect` or `assert` interface:

```javascript
// expect
expect(foo).to.deep.identically.equal(bar);
expect(foo).to.identically.equal(bar);

// assert
assert.deepEqualIdent(foo, bar);
assert.NotDeepEqualIdent(foo, bar);
```

### So, what is this really about?

Most deep equality tests (including `_.isEqual`) consider the following
structures as equal:

```javascript
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];
var foo = [a, a];
var bar = [a, b];
_.isEqual(foo , bar): // => true
```

Here, `foo` contains two reference to the same object, but `bar` contains
references to two different (not identical) objects. `a` and `b` might be itself
considered as equal (they do after all contain the same values), but the
*structures* of `foo` and `bar` are different.

`deepEqualIdent` will consider these values as not equal:

```javascript
deepEqualIdent(foo, bar); // => false
```

The following slightly different structures would be considered equal:

```javascript
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];
var foo = [a, a];
var bar = [b, b];
deepEqualIdent(foo, bar); // => true
```

### Why does it matter?

Let's have a look at another procedure to answer that question: *deep cloning*.
Given

```javascript
var a = [1,2,3];
var foo = [a, a];
```

a *good* deep cloning algorithm would recognize that both elements in `foo`
refer to the same object and thus would create a single copy of `a`:

```javascript
var a_copy = [1,2,3];
var foo_copy = [a_copy, a_copy];
```

This is desired because we want `foo_copy` behave *exactly* like `foo` when we
process it. I.e. if the first element is mutated, the second element should
mutate as well:

```javascript
foo_copy[0][0] += 1;
console.log(foo_copy); // => [[2,2,3], [2,2,3]]
```

If the deep copy algorithm would produce separate copies for each element in `foo`
instead

```javascript
var a_copy_1 = [1,2,3];
var a_copy_2 = [1,2,3];
var foo_copy = [a_copy_1, a_copy_2];
```

then mutating the first element of `foo_copy` would not produce the same result
as mutation the first element of `foo`, and thus it would not be an exact copy
of `foo`.

---

I hope this makes it clearer why considering the identity of objects during
comparison is important: To preserve the structural integrity. If two nested
structures are said to be equal, they should *behave* exactly the same for all
intends and purposes.

Another way to look at it is to visualize the relationship between the values as
graphs. Let's change the structure a bit:

```javascript
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];
var foo = [a, {x: a}];
var bar = [a, {x: b}];
```

Graph representations:

```
   - foo -        - bar -
  |       |      |       |
  v       v      v       v
  a <--- { }     a      { }
                         |
                         v
                         b
```

I think this makes it very obvious that the structure of `foo` and `bar` are
different and thus would produce different results when processed.

### OK, so how did you implement it?

It's really straightforward. Just like with deep cloning, we have to keep
track of which objects we already encountered in `a` and associate it with the
corresponding value in `b`. Interestingly, deep cloning methods that can handle
cycles are already doing this, but only vertically, not horizontally. It shouldn't
be too much effort to modif
